**Mercury Barometer**

The mercury barometer is the oldest type of barometer, invented by the Italian physicist Evangelista Torricelli in 1643. Torricelli conducted his first barometric experiments using a tube of water. Water is relatively light in weight, so a very tall tube with a large amount of water had to be used in order to compensate for the heavier weight of atmospheric pressure.

Torricelli's water barometer was more than 10 meters (35 feet) in height, which rose above the roof of his home! This odd device caused suspicion among Torricelli's neighbours, who thought he was involved in witchcraft. In order to keep his experiments more secretive, Torricelli deduced that he could create a much smaller barometer using mercury, a silvery liquid that weighs 14 times as much as water.

A mercury barometer has a glass tube that is closed at the top and open at the bottom. At the bottom of the tube is a pool of mercury. The mercury sits in a circular, shallow dish surrounding the tube. The mercury in the tube will adjust itself to match the atmospheric pressure above the dish. As the pressure increases, it forces the mercury up the tube. The tube is marked with a series of measurements that track the number of atmospheres or bars. Observers can tell what the air pressure is by looking at where the mercury stops in the barometer.

**Aneroid Barometer**

In 1844, the French scientist Lucien Vidi invented the aneroid barometer. An aneroid barometer has a sealed metal chamber that expands and contracts, depending on the atmospheric pressure around it. Mechanical tools measure how much the chamber expands or contracts. These measurements are aligned with atmospheres or bars.

The aneroid barometer has a circular display that indicates the present number of atmospheres, much like a clock. One hand moves clockwise or counter clockwise to point to the current number of atmospheres. The terms stormy, rain, change, fair, and dry are often written above the numbers on the dial face to make it easier for people to interpret the weather. Aneroid barometers slowly replaced mercury barometers because they were easier to use, cheaper to buy, and easier to transport since they had no liquid that could spill.

Some aneroid barometers use a mechanical tool to track the changes in atmospheric pressure over a period of time. These aneroid barometers are called barographs. Barographs are barometers connected to needles that make marks on a roll of adjacent graph paper. The barograph records the number of atmospheres on the vertical axis and units of time on the horizontal. A barograph's tracking tool will rotate, usually once every day, week, or month. The spikes in the graph show when air pressure was high or low, and how long those pressure systems lasted. A severe storm, for instance, would appear as a deep, wide dip on a barograph.

**Uses:**

1. Aneroid barometers are used to determine whether atmospheric pressure is rising or declining.
2. Aneroid barometers are commonly used in homes and recreational boats to measure pressure.
3. Barographs in meteorology and altimeters on modern aircraft are examples of other applications.
4. This form of barometer can predict if a high or low pressure system is approaching, as well as whether it is intensifying.
5. Aneroid barometers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including the altimeter, which measures altitude (distance above sea level).
6. A barograph, a modified aneroid barometer that produces continual readings of atmospheric pressure on graph paper, is another example.
7. The aneroid barometer can hold a week's worth of data when utilised in this manner.
8. For weather map icons that show the weather graphically.
9. Pressure is measured by the sensor.
10. The powertrain control module uses it to control engine timing and fuel trim.

**Six's Maximum & Minimum Thermometer**

Six's thermometer is a thermometer which can measure the maximum and minimum temperature during a given time, devised by James Six in 1782. It is also known as a Maximum minimum thermometer. It is still in common use wherever a simple way is needed to measure the extremes of temperature at a location, e.g., in meteorology and horticulture.

It consists of a U-shaped capillary tube with two separate temperature readings, one for the maximum temperature and one for the minimum temperature. There are bulbs at the top of each arm of the U-shaped tube. The one at the top of the minimum reading scale contains alcohol, the other contains a vacuum or low-pressure alcohol vapour.

In the bend of the U is a section of mercury which is pushed around the tube by the expansion and contraction of the alcohol in the first bulb. It is the alcohol which measures the temperature, the mercury indicates the temperature reading on both scales.

At any given time, the position of the mercury should be the same on both the maximum and minimum scales. If not, then the instrument scales are not correctly positioned.

As the mercury moves it pushes 2 small steel markers which are sprung into the tube. They record the furthest point reached by the mercury in each arm of the tube. When the temperature reverses and the mercury is moved in the opposite direction by the expansion or contraction of the alcohol, the sprung markers remain in the tube at the furthest position they have been pushed by the mercury. They thus record the extremes of temperature experienced by the device since it was last reset.

The markers are reset by using a small magnet which can drag the markers along the tube so that they again rest on the surface of the mercury. In some designs the tube is horizontal and the markers un-sprung so the device is reset by turning it to the vertical so that gravity returns the markers to the mercury.

Its important to note that the alcohol is used as the thermometric liquid, while the mercury only serves as an indicator.

**Uses:**

1. It is used to record the severe of temperature at a particular location.

2. It is used to measure the maximum and minimum temperature of the air.

9. It is used by gardeners

10. It can be used by weather department

**Anemometer**

anemometer, device for measuring the speed of airflow in the atmosphere, in wind tunnels, and in other gas-flow applications. Most widely used for wind-speed measurements is the revolving-cup electric anemometer, in which the revolving cups drive an electric generator. The output of the generator operates an electric meter that is calibrated in wind speed. The useful range of this device is approximately from 5 to 100 knots. A propeller may also be used to drive the electric generator, as in the propeller anemometer. In another type of wind-driven unit, revolving vanes operate a counter, the revolutions being timed by a stopwatch and converted to airspeed. This device is especially suited for the measurement of low airspeeds.

A stream of air striking the open end of a tube closed at the other end will build up pressure within the tube. The difference in pressure between the interior of this tube (called a pitot tube) and the surrounding air can be measured and converted to airspeed. Pitot tubes are also used to measure the flow of liquids, particularly in the course of flume studies in fluid mechanics. This anemometer is most useful, however, in strong, steady air streams, such as in wind tunnels and aboard aircraft in flight. With modifications, it can be used to measure supersonic air flow. Another type of pressure anemometer is the Venturi tube, which is open at both ends and of larger diameter at the ends than at the middle. Airspeed is determined by measuring the pressure at the constriction in the tube. Venturi tubes have some applications in industry.

**Types**

1. Velocity: Cup, Vane, Hot-wire, Laser Droplet, Ultrasonic, Acoustic Resonance, Ping pong ball
2. Pressure: Plate, Tube, Pilot tube static

8. It is used at the weather station from the frigid Arctic to warm equatorial regions.
9. It is used by the engineers to make the vehicle more aerodynamic.
10. Used by skydivers to evaluate wind velocity before they leap into the abyss.

**Rain Gauge**

A rain gauge (also known as udometer, pluvia metior, pluviometer, ombrometer, and hyetometer) is an instrument used by meteorologists and hydrologists to gather and measure the amount of liquid precipitation over a predefined area, over a period of time. It is used for determining the depth of precipitation (usually in mm) that occurs over a unit area and thus measuring rainfall amount. The three major types of rain gauges are the standard gauge, tipping bucket gauge and weighing gauge.

1. **The Standard Rain Gauge**

The recording of rainfall using the standard or funnel rain gauge is generally done manually. These gauges work by catching the falling rain in a funnel-shaped collector that is attached to a measuring tube. The area of the collector is 10 times that of the tube; thus, the rain gauge works by magnifying the liquid by a factor of 10. Magnifying the rain in this way allows precise measurements down to a one-hundredth of an inch.

1. **The Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge**

The operation of a tipping bucket rain gauge is quite different from the standard gauge. The receiving funnel leads to one of two small buckets. Filling of one bucket occurs at one-hundredth of an inch. The result is a "tipping" of the liquid into the outer shell of the gauge, triggering the second bucket to take its place. The process then repeats itself, allowing for precise measurement of rainfall intensity and amount. This gauge has become standard for wireless weather stations.

1. **The Weighing Rain Gauge**

The universal weighing rain gauge is optimal for climatology use. This is because of a vacuum that accounts for the effects of wind, allowing more rain to enter the gauge. These gauges are very precise in measuring rainfall intensity as the weighing mechanism at the bottom of the collector can be used to measure depth and time simultaneously. Recording is carried out much in the same way as the older versions of the tipping bucket gauges.

**Uses:**

1. To determine the amount of fluid in a specific precipitated space during a set period of time.

2. This approach allows you to calculate the amount of precipitation that has fallen on a given area.

3. A pluviometer measures the amount of rain that falls in a certain area.

4.It also aids in the essential identification of drought-prone areas.

5. A Geostorm can be detected using a rain gauge.

6. Climate adversity is a function of precipitation; therefore, it may be examined across time.

7. In the long run, this research will aid in catastrophe preparedness.

8. Rain gauges of many types configure various aspects of rain, such as a weighted precipitation gauge.

9. The type of rain is determined by the tipping bucket gauge.

10. Rain drop size distribution can be studied using an acoustic rain gauge.

**Hygrometer**

A hygrometer is an instrument used to measure the amount of water vapor in air, in soil, or in confined spaces. Humidity measurement instruments usually rely on measurements of some other quantities such as temperature, pressure, mass, a mechanical or electrical change in a substance as moisture is absorbed. By calibration and calculation, these measured quantities can lead to a measurement of humidity. Modern electronic devices use the temperature of condensation (called the dew point), or they sense changes in electrical capacitance or resistance to measure humidity differences. A crude hygrometer was invented by Leonardo da Vinci in 1480. Major leaps came forward during the 1600s; Francesco Folli invented a more practical version of the device, while Robert Hooke improved a number of meteorological devices including the hygrometer. A more modern version was created by Swiss polymath Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1755. Later, in the year 1783, Swiss physicist and Geologist Horace Bénédict de Saussure invented the first hygrometer using human hair to measure humidity.

There are many types of hygrometers used to calculate humidity.

1. **Mechanical Hygrometer**

Organic substances (thin materials such as human hair, ox gut, etc.) expand and contract according to the variation in humidity. As variations occur in the material used, the spring of the mechanical hygrometer moves the needle on the dial. Thus, relative humidity can be calculated.

1. **Electrical Hygrometer**

An electrical hygrometer measures humidity by analysing the variation in electrical resistance of a fine layer of a semiconductor device. On the other hand, other hygrometers detect variations in transparency, weight or volume of substances that respond to humidity. Predominantly there are two types of electrical hygrometers- Resistive Hygrometer and Capacitive Hygrometer.

1. **Dew-point Hygrometer**

Dew-point Hygrometer usually consists of a polished mirror (made of metal) that is cooled at a fixed pressure and vapour content till moisture just begins to settle on it. Dew point is the metal's temperature at which condensation starts.

1. **Psychrometer**

The psychrometer is a hygrometer consisting of two thermometers, wet-bulb and dry-bulb. They are used to determine humidity through evaporation. The wet-bulb thermometer is covered with a wet cloth at its enlarged side. By thoroughly rotating both thermometers or gusting air over the bulbs, there will be a change in temperature. Humidity in the air can be measured by analysing the temperature difference between the wet-bulb and the dry-bulb.

**Uses:**

1. The determination of atmospheric moisture
2. used to detect the presence of water vapour in a gaseous mixture.
3. used to gauge the amount of moisture in the air.
4. Various production processes that use it.
5. utilised for weather forecasting.
6. used to describe the relative humidity percentage.
7. used as a method of food preservation.
8. used to describe the pressure in particular situations.
9. used in saunas and museums.
10. used to maintain wooden musical instruments such as guitars and violins.

**Wind vane**

A wind vane, weather vane, or weathercock is an instrument used for showing the direction of the wind. It is typically used as an architectural ornament to the highest point of a building. The word vane comes from the Old English word "fana", meaning "flag".

Although partly functional, wind vanes are generally decorative, often featuring the traditional cockerel design with letters indicating the points of the compass. Other common motifs include ships, arrows, and horses. Not all wind vanes have pointers. In a sufficiently strong wind, the head of the arrow or cockerel (or equivalent) will indicate the direction from which the wind is blowing. Wind vanes are also found on small wind turbines to keep the wind turbine pointing into the wind.

There are three primary types of wind vanes: the classic weathervane, wind sock, and digital wind vane.

1. **Weathervane –** In use for centuries, these are the type often seen on top of barns, cathedrals, and a variety of other buildings. Since weathervanes are also used for decorative purposes (in addition to functional applications), they can take on a variety of shapes and styles. The classic style features a fin in the shape of a rooster, but a variety of other fin shapes can be featured. They can include the silhouette of a noteworthy person, a ship, fish, tractor, or a simple arrow. Typically, beneath the fin, you'll see situated four horizontal posts that read "N," "S," "E," and "W" (north, south, east, and west) to help the viewer determine the wind direction. Reading a weathervane is easy. Whichever direction the fin is pointing will indicate where the wind is coming from.

1. **Wind Sock –** This type of wind vane is primarily seen in airports, near runways. While a wind sock determines the wind direction, it generally does not indicate a north/south/east/west direction. However, based on how much the sock is inflated, the viewer can estimate the strength of the wind.

1. **Digital Wind Vane –** A digital wind vane shares many basic design elements with a classic weathervane, but is significantly more sophisticated. Quite often, a digital wind vane is seen as a component of a weather station, which will also measure conditions such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and sometimes rainfall.

**Uses:**

1. Used to identify the direction of the wind.
2. Used as a decorative piece.
3. Provide weather information.
4. To identify the intensity of storms.
5. By using wind vane, we can protect the people form strong storms and winds.
6. It is used to measure pressure and speed of winds.
7. It is used to predict the weather reports.
8. It is used as a compass.
9. Used as a navigational device in boats.
10. It is also used in sailing.
